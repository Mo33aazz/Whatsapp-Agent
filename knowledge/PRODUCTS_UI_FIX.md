Title: Products & Services UI Fix Summary

Date: 2025-09-02

Issue
- Users could not see the "Edit Products" or "Add Product" controls.
- Empty state message ("No products...") was not centered.

Root Cause
- The only "Edit Products" button existed inside `#productsSuccess`, which defaults to `display: none`, so no visible entry point to switch to edit mode.
- The empty state had `text-align:center` but no vertical centering or minimum height.

Changes
- public/index.html
  - Added a persistent header with a visible `#editProductsBtn` next to the section title.
  - Removed the duplicate button inside `#productsSuccess` to avoid hidden/duplicate IDs.

- public/css/components.css
  - Added `.products-header` (flex container for title + actions).
  - Centered the empty state by making `.empty-products` a flex column and adding `min-height` to `.products-grid`.

Behavior
- On load: display mode shows the grid (or centered empty state) and a visible "Edit Products" button.
- Edit button: reveals the edit form (with "Add Product"), hides the grid and the button.
- Save/Cancel: returns to display mode and shows the header button again; success message appears briefly on save.
